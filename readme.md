# reef

To stick with a fish theme, I've chosen to go with the name reef, and to keep
the metaphor going, plugins are called corals.

I made this because while I like the simplicity of fisher, I don't like how
everything is clobbered in the main fish folder. With this design, each plugin
has it's own folder while still keeping things very simple.

## compatability

Fisher, omf plugins, and anything following the standard `functions/`,
`conf.d/` etc directory structre are compatible. reef will not honor any
`init.fish` file however, although functionality can be copied into a file in
functions.
